# Drivers-drowsiness-detection

This project is about detecting the drivers' drowsiness by face recognition using Haar-cascade algorithm, classifying if the driver was sleepy or not by using different classification algorithms and comparing these algorithms to compare and contrast the results obtained by them. This is done using python programming.
